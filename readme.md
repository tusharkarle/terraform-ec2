Getting Started with Terraform for AWS EC2 Instance

Steps:

1. Configuration: Create a new directory for your Terraform project and create a .tf file (e.g., ec2_instance.tf) to define your EC2 instance.

2. Initializing: Run "terraform init" in your project directory. This command initializes Terraform and downloads the necessary AWS provider.

3. Planning: Execute "terraform plan" to see what changes Terraform will apply to your AWS infrastructure. This step helps you review and validate your EC2 instance configuration before making any changes.

4. Applying Changes: Once you're satisfied with the plan, run "terraform apply" to create your EC2 instance. Terraform will ask for confirmation before making any changes.

5. Accessing the EC2 Instance: After Terraform finishes provisioning, you can access your EC2 instance using SSH (for Linux instances) or RDP (for Windows instances), depending on your chosen AMI.

6. Destroying Resources: When you no longer need your EC2 instance, use "terraform destroy" to remove it and avoid incurring unnecessary AWS charges.
